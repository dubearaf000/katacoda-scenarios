## What is Elastifile
Elastifile provides elastic file storage for the Google Cloud. It acts as a middle man, allowing non-native file systems to be stored in the cloud.

This scenario gives you access to a Elastifile cloud cluster, which will allow you to create a file, store it in the cloud, read from it, update it and ultimately delete it.
