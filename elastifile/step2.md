## Using SSH to connect to the cluster
Since you now have access to the Google Cloud command line, you can use this to SSH to the actual Elastifile cluster.

SSH is a protocol for sending data securely and wirelessly to another device.
This can be used to send commands directly to the Elastifile cluster.

Use the command `gcloud compute ssh root@katacoda`{{execute}} to establish a secure SSH connection.
When prompted, answer with 'y' and leave the password blank.
